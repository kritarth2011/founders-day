            Welcome to our Founders Day project! This year, we honor the powerful values of
            harmony and empathy. In a world full of diversity, it is crucial to build bridges of
            understanding and work together peacefully. Harmony allows us to coexist and
            collaborate, while empathy helps us truly connect with one another. Explore how
            these values shape our community and the world around us.

Harmony is the ability of people with different ideas, cultures, and opinions to live
together peacefully. It means finding common ground, working together, and
respecting differences. Harmony allows us to achieve more together, whether it’s in
a team, a school, or a community.
